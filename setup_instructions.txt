1. Clone the repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-todo-app.git
cd cloud-todo-app

2. Install dependencies
Navigate to the backend/ directory and install the necessary dependencies for the backend:

cd backend
npm install

3. Deploy the Backend
To deploy the backend to AWS, use the Serverless Framework:

Deploy the backend:

serverless deploy

This will:
Deploy the Lambda functions.
Create an API Gateway to expose the Lambda functions as HTTP endpoints.
Set up a DynamoDB table to store the to-do items.

Retrieve the API Gateway URL: Once the deployment is complete, Serverless will provide you with the API endpoint URL. 
Copy the API Gateway URL from the output.

4. Configure the Frontend
Open the frontend/app.js file and update the API_BASE_URL with the API Gateway URL you copied in the previous step:

const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-api-gateway-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/todos';

5. Host the Frontend
You can host the frontend on AWS S3 or any static hosting provider. Hereâ€™s how you can host the frontend on AWS S3:

Create an S3 Bucket:
Go to the AWS S3 Console and create a new S3 bucket. Make sure the bucket name is globally unique.
Upload Files:
Upload the contents of the frontend/ directory (i.e., index.html, app.js, style.css) to your newly created S3 bucket.
Enable Static Website Hosting:
In the S3 bucket settings, enable Static Website Hosting and note the Bucket Website Endpoint URL.
Access the App:
Once the frontend is hosted, navigate to the Bucket Website Endpoint URL to access your to-do app.
